## How to report the results


Send an email to me at dubzed@gmail.com. which includes:

  * the name and version of your operating system (e.g Linux Mint 18.3, Mac, Windows)
  * whether it's ok to contact you with questions
  * the results of the tests as shown below

The expected result is a long list of the word "ok".  If that's what you
see, report the results as "all tests passed".  Otherwise, please take a
